<p>Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives in a futuristic world in which society is divided into five factions. As each person enters adulthood, he or she must choose a faction and commit to it for life. Tris chooses Dauntless -- those who pursue bravery above all else. However, her initiation leads to the discovery that she is a Divergent and will never be able to fit into just one faction. Warned that she must conceal her status, Tris uncovers a looming war which threatens everyone she loves.</p>
 <h2>Reviews</h2>
 <h3>In short, Beatrice is the kind of person the factions can't easily control. She doesn't feel dangerous. But she is. She's an anomaly that can threaten the whole system. And so she has to make sure she keeps her added abilities under wraps and not draw any attention to herself.

Because the so-called Divergents actually don't get a choice.

They get to be â€¦ eliminated.(Plugged In)</h3>

 <h3>Divergent, falls somewhere in a middle ground between high points of The Hunger Games and the low points of The Twilight Saga(Screen Rant)</h3>
