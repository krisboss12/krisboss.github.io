<p>From filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the science fiction action adventure “Ready Player One,” based on Ernest Cline’s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon. The film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse. But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance). When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.</p>
 <h2>Reviews</h2>
 <h3>Ready Player One illustrates the colorful appeal and potential of a creative, swirling virtual reality. But it also warns that being fully consumed by such a false reality is unhealthy. In fact, Halliday's key challenges all seem to connect in some way to his own personal laments about the time and relationships he lost in the course of creating OASIS.(Plugged In)</h3>

 <h3>Adapted from the novel by Ernest Cline, Ready Player One is another deep dive into the well of motion-capture filmmaking for legendary director Steven Spielberg. Like his mo-cap animated The Adventures of Tintin and mo-cap heavy The BFG adaptation before it, Ready Player One allows Spielberg to revel in the freedom that the technology affords him, when it comes to visualizing fantastical worlds and characters on the big screen. The film struggles in the same way that those movies did too, even as it attempts to infuse its pop literary source material and shiny visuals with a heavy dose of Spielbergian heart. An impressive work of technical showmanship, Ready Player One nevertheless falls short of recapturing that old-school Spielberg blockbuster magic.(Screen Rant)</h3>
